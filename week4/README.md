# Week 4: AssignmentðŸ’¡

<h1>Question 1</h1>

**Description**

Given an array of positive integers, write a C Program to output the sum of the elements that are above the mean.

Given an array $a_1 ,a_2 ,â€¦,a_n$
, the mean of the array is defined as $\sum_{n=1}^n ={ a_i \over 2 }$
.

**Input**

The first line contains the size of the array.
The second line contains the contents of the array. 

**Output** 

Output the sum of elements in the array which are greater than or equal to the mean.
  
Note : The size of the array is always smaller than 20.

<h1>Question 2</h1>

**Description**

Given two arrays of positive integers, write a C Program to output the smallest number in the first array that is also present in the second one.

**Input**

The first line contains the size of the first array.
The second line contains the contents of first array. 
The third line contains the size of the second array.
The fourth line contains the contents of second array. 

**Outpu**

Output the smallest number occurring in the first array that also occurs in the second.
In case there is no such number, output -1.

Note : The sizes of the arrays are smaller than 20.

<h1>Question 3</h1>

**Anagram Checking**

Given two strings(character arrays), write a C Program to check if one of them is an anagram of the other.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

Examples are LISTEN and SILENT , KNEE and KEEN.

**Input**

The first line contains the size of the character array.
The second line contains the contents of first array. 
The third line contains the contents of the second array.

Note: The maximum size of the character array can be assumed to be 20.
The contents of both arrays are only upper case alphabets.

**Output** 

1 If the contents of the arrays are anagrams
0 If the contents of the arrays are not anagrams
