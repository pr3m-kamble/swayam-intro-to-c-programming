 <h1>Question 1</h1>

 **Parity Checker**

You are given a sequence of bits (1's and 0's).
The sequence is said to have even parity if and only if the number of 1's in the sequence if even.

Write a C program to that outputs 1 if the sequence has even parity and 0 otherwise.

**Input**

A sequence of bits (0's and 1's) ending with a -1.
(Note : -1 is not a part of input. It only signifies that input has ended)

**Output**

1 if the number of ones in the sequence is even.
0 if the number of ones in the sequence is odd.

<h1>Question 2</h1>

**Count the Number of 0's Between the First and Last 1**
You are given a binary sequence.

Write a C program to count the number of 0's between the first and last 1 in the sequence.

**Input**

A sequence of bits (0's and 1's) ending with a -1.
(Note : -1 is not a part of input. It only signifies that input has ended)

**Output**

The number of 0's Between the First and Last 1 in the sequence.
